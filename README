random_wiki
Matt Nichols

random_wiki is a Python script which tweets the first sentence of a random Wikipedia article and a shortened link to said article several times a day. Using several rules, the script attempts to generate an aesthetic tweet (avoiding common garbage from in-process pages, uncommon formattings, and the like), and determine a reasonable amount of time to wait before tweeting again. The latter is mostly random, but varies somewhat by time of day (tweets should be more frequent around 2:00pm, and less frequent in the middle of the night).

Known issues:

- Sentence endings are determined using periods, but excepting circumstances to which any of several rules apply ("Dr.", "U.S.A.", or "Ph.D." are examples where this is necessary). However, there's no way I've catalogued all possible abbreviations, so there will inevitably be some errors here.
- The body of the article is found by the first <p> segment of the Wikipedia webpage, but occasionally a page has additional information which precedes the actual body in the markup, and can be mistaken for its real beginning. The "Synonyms" section of some pages is an example.
- This readme could be more detailed.
